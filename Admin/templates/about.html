    <h2><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> About the Solar Panel Washer</h2>
    <p>
      This system is designed to ensure your solar panels stay clean, enhancing their efficiency and lifespan. It supports both <strong>Automatic</strong> and <strong>Manual</strong> modes to meet your convenience and safety requirements.
    </p>
  
    <ul class="mode-details">
      <li>
        <i class="fas fa-robot"></i>
        <strong>Auto Mode:</strong> Operates automatically based on a predefined schedule (e.g., every 7 or 15 days). This ensures your panels remain clean without any manual intervention.
      </li>
  
      <li>
        <i class="fas fa-hand-holding-water"></i>
        <strong>Manual Mode:</strong> Allows you to start a wash manually. <strong>However, this mode is only available between <span class="highlight-time">7 PM and 7 AM</span></strong> to prevent thermal shock risks.
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>Why Manual Mode is Time-Restricted:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Washing during the day can crack or damage solar panels due to heat from sunlight.</li>
        <li>Cooler nighttime temperatures reduce thermal stress, making it safer to clean.</li>
        <li>Protects panel coating and improves overall durability.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  
    <p class="closing-text">
      By using this system, you help your solar installation work at peak performance while extending its operational life. Stay green and efficient!
